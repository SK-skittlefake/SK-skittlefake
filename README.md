# 👋 Hi there, everyone!
- 👋 Hey, I’m Tran Xuan Thanh, but you can just call me "skittlefake", "skittlefake1" or simply "sk".
- 🎂 14 years old.
- 🇻🇳 Proudly from Vietnam.
- 😃 Pronouns: he/him.
- 👀 I have a passion for coding (just for fun).
- 🌱 I'm currently delving into C/C++ and algorithms to sharpen my coding skills.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Previously, I experimented with various JavaScript libraries, but I've now found stability in working with React and Angular.

*Note: My English grammar and vocabulary aren't perfect, so every now and then I rely on tools like Google Translate or ChatGPT. But hey, I'm determined to get better!*
